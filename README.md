Designed for use as a browser source in OBS or similar streaming software. Note that you for OBS need to start it with the --enable-media-stream flag so it's able to access your microphone; see https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/browser-source-doesnt-allow-microphone-consent-dialogs.80260/ for more info.
